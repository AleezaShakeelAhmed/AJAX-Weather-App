# AJAX-Weather-App

This project is a simple weather application built as a practice exercise for AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) technology. The application allows users to retrieve weather information for different cities and countries around the world.

## Overview

Weather information is fetched from a weather API using AJAX requests. Users can input the name of a city or country, and the application will display the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description.

## Features

- **Search by City or Country**: Users can enter the name of a city or country to retrieve weather information.
- **Dynamic Updating**: The application dynamically updates the weather information without requiring a full page reload.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive and work well on various screen sizes, including mobile devices.
